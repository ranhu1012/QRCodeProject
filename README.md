## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS



### What I learned

This is my first project at Front End Mentor. It's just a simple one-page project. But I'm learning SASS recently. So, I used SASS wrote the CSS for this project. I practiced following skills:
1. Setup working environment to compile SASS to CSS in VSCode.
2. CSS variables. 
3. Use of SASS partial files.
4. Align elements with flex box.
5. CSS stacking and z-index.

Some of the snippets I practiced:


```css
:root {
  --container-background:  hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --page-background: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --title-color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  --text-color:  hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --link-color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);

}
```SASS
@forward 'boilerplate';
@forward 'colors';
@forward 'typography';
```


### Continued development
1. Position and align elements with CSS.
2. Mobile first responsive desgin.
